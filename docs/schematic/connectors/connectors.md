# Connectors

We have 2 options
- Using high-speed edge connectors
- Using high-speed vertical connectors
- Using high-speed 90-degree angle connectors

## 90 degree vertical connectors
The main issue with those kind-of connectors is the pricepoint. Mechanical connectors with the ability to hold other PCB's at a 90 degree up-right are pretty expensive.

## vertical connectors
They are cheaper, however in order to use those we need
- OR mechanically small components in the space between the 2 boards (otherwise they mide impede the connection between the 2 boards)
- OR double-sided component assembly

Given the lower price-point we're aiming for, we'd want to do single-sided assembly only. Connectors put on top won't make the board connect unless we put the larger components on one side and only connect on the edge of the board.

The advanced ones of this version also only work for standard assembly, not for economic assembly.

### HC-PBB40C-100DS-0.4V-4.0-02
- VERY EXPENSIVE: 1.5 euros a pop
- Economic assembly

###  HRS Hirose
- Price is OK (0.69 + 0.94) for 90 connections
- DF40C-90DS-0.4V(51)
- DF40C-90DP-0.4V(51)
- Enough in stock
- Economic assembly

- There's a 100 or even a 120 pin variant of it as well: might be a better option, in this case we need only a single one
	- 120 is the biggest one -> But not that many available. 
	- Take either the 100 or the 90 pin variant.
	- 90 pins -> max 45 connections (if no power)
	- 100 pins -> max 50 connections (if no power)

BIG PRO:
- It seems like the height of these connectors can be higher than other components
- So we might get away with putting it centrally on the boards with other components around it instead of banning it to the edge because it would otherwise interfere with other IC's mechanically

## Edge-board connectors
Edge-board connectors are a good alternative, since they need to only be placed "on the edge".
They are however pretty expensive and there's not that many of them available with good pin amounts.

### DF36-15S-0.4V(51)
- 0.446 euros per piece
- Economic assembly
