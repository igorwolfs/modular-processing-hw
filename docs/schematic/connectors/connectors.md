# Connectors

We have 2 options
- Using high-speed edge connectors
- Using high-speed vertical connectors
- Using high-speed 90-degree angle connectors

## 90 degree vertical connectors
The main issue with those kind-of connectors is the pricepoint. Mechanical connectors with the ability to stand 90 degree up-right are pretty expensive.

## 
Instead of using connectors placed on the top / bottom side, consider using high-speed connectors on the edge of the board to keep manufacturing cost low.

Mechanically, connectors put on top won't make the board connect unless we put the larger components on one side and only connect on the edge of the board.
